This is a Tic Tac Toe game made with C#. I thought building it would be difficult at first, but thanks to the Microsoft Forms Designer, it turned out to be pretty easy. The designer helped generate the classes and UI elements automatically, which made development faster and smoother. It also provides a good GUI experience compared to other programming languages I’ve worked with.

I did struggle a bit with getting the game tie pop-up to work, and it was all because of a small mistake on my end. After spending some time figuring it out and debugging, I finally got the complete solution I expected — and it felt really satisfying.
